# Modern Data Analysis for Biomedical Research
## Molecules to Medicines, October 2018

*Adam Claridge-Chang*

As research and data collection becomes increasingly digital, and analysis methods grow more sophisticated, it is now an essential skill for biomedical scientists to know [how to code](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/biologists-teaching-code-survive/ "WIRED: Want to make it as a biologist? Better learn to code."). While Duke-NUS does not offer a full course in scientific programming, I am able to offer a one hour orientation that aims to get you started building this important skill. My colleague Joses Ho will be presenting part of the Jupyter notebook.

## Preparation

*If you encounter difficulties below, ask your classmates for help. If this fails, we work on it in the class.*

- Install [Anaconda for Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download/ "You'll want to get Python 3.7") on your laptop.
- Launch [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html "JupyterLab Overview"). There are 2 ways to do this.
  - Either start Anaconda Navigator and Launch `jupyterlab`.
  - Start PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac OS X / Linux) and enter
  ```shell
  jupyter lab
  ```
- Download this notebook: An Introduction to JupyterLab (Link TBA).
- In the File Browser panel in JupyterLab, navigate to the folder you downloaded the notebook to. Locate the notebook, and open it simply by double-clicking on it!
- There is a Google Sheet available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F0c5I_S9_NnLKPMQxJkEfzGfhzQeR26SgkiHSTFwKDE/edit?usp=sharing "Link to Google Sheet").
Open and have a look at it, this is the sample multivariate data we will use in the class.


## In class
- In the session, we will go through an introduction to Scientific Python: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, matplotlib. The more you can learn about these reading online before the session, the more you will get out of the session.
- Bring your laptop. We will go through the notebook and use the code to analyze the data from the Google Sheet.

## Further reading
- There is a new [textbook](http://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "The New Statistics") for learning estimation, very well written, clear and funny.
- There is a mini-classic estimation [textbook](http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0727913751.html "Statistics with Confidence") by leading statisticians.
- There are four legendary [books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/ "Tufte's website") on data visualization by Edward Tufte.
