Second, the core programming languages supported by Jupyter are Julia, Python and R. While the name Jupyter is not a direct acronym for these languages, it nods its head in those directions. In particular, the \"y\" in the middle of Jupyter was chosen to honor our Python heritage. Third, Galileo was the first person to discover the moons of Jupiter. His publication on the moons of Jupiter is an early example of research that includes the underlying data in the publication. This is one of the core ideas and requirements for scientific reproducibility. Reproducibility is one of the main focuses of our project. \n",
